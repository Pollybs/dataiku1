<h1>Dataiku ML Project: Prediction of heart attack failures using the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset</h1>

Project Objective: Build a precise predictive model leveraging machine learning techniques on the Dataiku DSS platform to forecast heart failure incidents accurately.  The model was trained and tested using Python and the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset.

<h2>Project Steps: </h2>

Using Python notebooks and Dataiku Machine Learning experiment tracking capabilities, I went through:
- Configuration of the Dataiku DSS environment and project,

- Data preparation and EDA,
  
- Configuration of a Dataiku Flow
  
- Machine learning experimentation using classic scikit-learn models,
  
- Model evaluation.
