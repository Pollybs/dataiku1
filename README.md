<h1>Dataiku ML Project: Prediction of heart attack failures using the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset</h1>

The goal of this project is to predict heart attack failures, using the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset. 

<h2>Project Steps: </h2>
Using python notebooks and Dataiku Machine Learning experiment tracking capabilities, the project will go through data preparation, machine learning experimentation using classic scikit-learn models, and model evaluation.
